Decision Making:

Conditional Statements: MySQL provides conditional statements that can be 
used in queries to make decisions based on data values. These include:

IF statements
CASE statements
Conditional expressions using operators like =, >, <, BETWEEN, etc.

1. IF Statement:

The IF statement is used to perform conditional logic within a query.
It evaluates a condition and returns a specific value based on whether 
the condition is true or false.

Syntax:

SELECT IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false);

2. CASE Statement:

The CASE statement provides more flexibility than the IF statement and 
is similar to a switch-case structure in programming. It allows you to 
evaluate multiple conditions and return different values based on which 
condition is met.

Syntax:

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ...
        ELSE default_result
    END

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    grade DECIMAL(5, 2)
);


INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, grade) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 85.5),
(2, 'Bob', 92.0),
(3, 'Charlie', 78.0),
(4, 'David', 88.5),
(5, 'Eve', 95.0);

select * from students;

if statement:

select student_id,name,grade,if(grade>70,'pass','Fail') as status from students;


case statement:

select student_id,name,grade,
case 
	when grade>90 then 'excellent'
	when grade>80 then 'good'
	else 'average'
end as category, 
if(grade>70,'pass','Fail') as status
from students;
